# Getting Started
Here's how to get started with QuantoUI:

1. Download the relevant minified [CSS](https://github.com/Quantosec/QuantoUI/blob/master/quantoui.min.css) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/Quantosec/QuantoUI/blob/master/quantoui.min.js) files.

2. Include the following lines in the `head` part of your HTML page. Do this for all pages!

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="quantoui.min.css">
<script src="quantoui.min.js"></script>
```

Of course, rename the filenames and their paths to wherever you keep the files.

3. See our examples on how to code using QuantoUI!
